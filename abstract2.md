### Falling Life Expectancy in the US: Effects of the Opioid Crisis & Rising Suicide Rates
Sabrina Pereira & Ashley Swanson


In recent years, a downward trend in the Average Life Expectancy (ALE) in the US has emerged. At the same time, the number of deaths by opioid poisoning has increased dramatically, and suicide rates are on the rise. Using mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we quantify the effects of the increased deaths by opioid poising and suicide on the ALE in the US. Without opioid-related deaths, the ALE would have been 0.60 years higher in 2017 (79.22 years compared to 78.62 years), while the difference prior to 2007 was on average only .22 years. Without deaths by suicide, the ALE would have been 0.38 years higher in 2017 (79.00 years compare to 78.62 years), while the difference prior to 2007 was on average .27 years.

Findings show that the increasing suicides are not a primary contributer to the downward trend in ALE. However, we observed that without the effect of opioid-related deaths, the ALE would not be decreasing.
