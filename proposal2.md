# Contributing Factors to the Falling Life Expectancy in the US

### Ashley Swanson and Sabrina Pereira

## Project Exploration Description

For our project, we hope to extend on project 1 (The Contribution of the Opioid Epidemic on the Falling Life Expectancy in the US) but update it using the true life expectancy calculations used by the CDC- outlined in Method for Constructing Complete Annual U.S. Life Tables. This again would explore how the opioid epidemic may have impacted the life expectancy in the US. We will remove the effect of the deaths due to opioid abuse in the life expectancy calculation to see how much these deaths weigh in the calculation.

This would also allow us to analyze the effects of other variables (ie. suicide rates) on the life expectancy on the US in a possible extension.

## Data to Explore

We plan to explore the data from the CDC's National Vital Statistics System (NVSS, Links: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm, https://wonder.cdc.gov/mortSQL.html). The data is downloaded.

## Data Use Restrictions for the CDC data:
The data should only be used for health statistical reporting and analysis. For sub-national geography, we should not present or publish death counts of 9 or fewer or death rates based on counts of nine or fewer (in figures, graphs, maps, tables, etc.). We should also make no attempt to learn the identity of any person or establishment included in these data, and if an identity is discovered inadvertently, we should make no disclosure or other use of the identity and advise the NCHS Confidentiality Officer of any such discovery.
